# **Project 2 Ultra-Rare-Fight-Gear**

## **Welcome!**

For this webpage, I've created a mock page of a fight-gear shop while using new technologies to me! Feel free to add to the mongoDB linked to this page to populate more fight-gear neccessary to dominate opponents out on the mats! 

### Technologies Used
For the webpage, I used:
- EJS
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Express
- Mongoose
- MongoDB
- Heroku

## Plans for the Future
### For Future Enhancements of the Application:

- I'd like to customize the buttons more so that they look sleeker and more modern. Also adding a mouse hover over function.
- Add enlargement hover feature over each image on the index page
- Carousel for multiple angles of each product on their respective show page
- Add categories for each type of item, using tags associated with each of their properties
- Finally, a log-in feature for user's to be authorized for their reviews and add items to cart
